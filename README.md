I am a retired electronics engineer.  My speciality was stage lighting equipoment design - LED luminaires, dimmers and control consoles.  Now I am making valve (vacuum tube) amplifiers and various digital controllers based on Arduino.  JUST FOR FUN.
I have rudimentary coding skills but have coded in assembler for real-time cpus and dsps back in the day.  Now I write in C++ (badly).  I understand cpu and mcu operation at the silicon/registers level quite well.
Living in London UK, I also speak French well and write it badly.
